Monthly Reporting
=================

Each month, the treasurer is expected to present the board with a summary report of our financial position. This report should include:

    * reconciliation summary of our TD banking account (showing opening and closing balances)
    * reconciliation summary of our PayPal account (showing opening and closing balances)
    * Income & Expense report, summarizing the month's transactions
    * Balance Sheet, showing the closing balances of all accounts and subaccounts
    * AR Aging summary, showing how many active members are 0-30, 31-60, 61-90 days behind in dues
    * a list of all payments (cheques) made during the month
    
With the exception of the AR aging summary (which Quickbooks is unable to generate without names), these reports should be generated by Quickbooks rather than by hand. Email the full report to the members list, before presenting it to the board, and include some summary comments describing our performance for the month. For instance, you can comment on how many members were invoiced (and whether that's changed since the previous month), whether or not we received any donation money during the month, and highlight the sorts of spending we did. Commentary should be provided in lay terms -- the goal is to make sure the membership understands our financial position. 

A paper copy of this report should be printed off, and filed with account statements, invoices, and any other financial records for the month. Bring all paper records to the board meeting, when presenting the monthly report, so that any questions can be quickly answered.
