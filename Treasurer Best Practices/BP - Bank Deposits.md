Best Practices: Deposting Funds to Our Bank Account
===================================================

Cash & Cheque Deposits
----------------------

Cash & cheques should be deposited once a month (as needed). 

1. Prepare deposit in Quickbooks

All cash & cheques to be deposited should have already been recorded as received payments in Quickbooks. If any have not been recorded yet, do that before continuing. 

From the Quickbooks Home screen, click on "Record Deposits". This will bring up a window listing all of the money received as "Undeposited funds". Reconcile this against the actual cash & cheques you have to deposit. If a payment has been recorded as received, but is not appearing in this list, review the payment, and make sure it was recorded as "Deposit to: Undeposited Funds".

While this window is open (do not click "OK" yet), enter the deposit in the TD despoti book.

2. Prepare deposit in Deposit Book

Fill in the deposit details in our Deposit Book. On the left-hand side of the page, list each cheque by an identifying name (e.g., the member's last name), plus the cheque number, and then the amount on the cheque. Below this list, fill in the total value of all cheques, and the number of cheques that you have. You can calculate the total value of the cheques and verify the number of cheques, by selecting all of the cheques (and only the cheques) in the "Payments to Deposit" window. 

On the right-hand side, record all of the cash to be deposited, and the total value of the cash. Again, you can verify the total value by selecting all of the cash (and only the cash) in the "Payments to Deposit" window. 

Add the cash & cheque subtotals, to get the deposit total. This number should match the "Payments Subtotal" in the "Payments to Deposit" window in Quickbooks, when all payments are selected. 

3. Record Deposit in Quickbooks

Once the deposit book and "Payments to Deposit" window are in agreement (e.g., you have selected all of the deposits to be deposited, and the total values are the same), click "OK" on the "Payments to Deposit" window. 

4. Make Deposit at Bank

Take the deposit book along with cash & cheques to be deposited to the bank. The teller should take the top copy of the deposit book slip (leaving the carbon copy in tact). You may also get a printed receipt of the deposit. This will open a "Make Deposits" form. 

Set the "Deposit To" field to whichever account the majority of the deposited money should be placed. This is usually "Operations Fund", however if you are depositing a donation payment (and no membership dues), then this may be Discretionary or some other fund.

Make sure the "Date" is set to "today". If you will not be taking the deposit to the bank on the same day, you can post-date this to whether you will be making the deposit. It doesn't matter if this date is off by a day or two, as long as it's still in the same calendar month of when you make the deposit. 

Set "Memo" to a description of the deposit. The default "Deposit" is fine in most cases, but if you are making a special deposit (i.e., are depositing grant money), you may want to say so here. 

Underneath the list of payments, there is a "Cash Back" section, where you can allocate a portion of the deposit to a different account. For instance, if the deposit includes both membership dues and donations, you can use this to transfer the donation portion of the deposit to "Discretionary Fund", instead of the "Operations Fund". In this scenario:

  * Deposit To: Operations Fund
  * Cash back goes to: Discretionary Fund
  * Cash back memo: "Allocating donation portion of deposit"
  * Cash back amount: (what the donation amount was)

Note you can only do this cash back against one account. If your deposit includes funds for more than 2 accounts, you will need to make the initial deposit to 2 accounts, and then transfer funds between accounts after the fact. 

Save & Close.
