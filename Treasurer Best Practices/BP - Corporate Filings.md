FILING HST

Once all transactions for the year have been recorded, you can generate the Sales Tax Report from within QuickBooks.

    Sales Tax >> Tax Agency Report
    Tax Agency: Receiver General
    Period: Last Sales Tax Year (make sure the dates are filled in correctly: the sales tax year runs from Jan 1 to Dec 31)
    
If the numbers of the generated report look correct, click the "File Tax Report" button. This will archive the report to be filed within Quickboos (so you can review it under "Reports >> Sales Tax >>  View Prior Sales Tax Returns"), and will generate both PDF and TAX files for you. The PDF should be uploaded to GitHub (https://github.com/kwartzlab/corporate-filings/tree/master/HST). The TAX file can be used to upload your filing to CRA, although I have never done this.

There are multiple ways you can file HST with CRA; pick which ever method works best for you.
