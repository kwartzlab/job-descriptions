Best Practices: Membership Dues, Monthly Tasks
==============================================

Quickbooks will automatically generate monthly dues invoices every month of the 10th, however you still need to manually push them out to members.

On the 10th, open up Quickbooks. You should be presented with a pop-up, asking if QB can enter in the memorized invoices. Select yes.

Open up the Customer Centre, and filter the Customers & Jobs list to "Active Customers". This list should show you only current members (both active & on hiatus). Scan down the list, and look for any members who have a balance that is anything other than $56.50. 

Any member who has a balance that's greater than $56.50 has outstanding dues from previous months. If you have not already been in touch with them about their outstanding balance, send out a statement after you've sent them their latest invoice.

Any member who has a balance that's less than $56.50 (including negative amounts), has a credit on their account. Open up their account, and make sure all available credits are applied to any open invoices. If a member keeps credit on account (i.e., prepays several months in advance), and the current invoices uses up their available credit, send out their invoice individually, and include a note to let them know that its time to put more money on their account.

If there are any other members who need a personalized note with their invoice, email those out now as well. 

Once you've reviewed all of the open balances, and emailed out any invoices which needed personalized notes, batch send all of the remaining invoices.

    1) Open up one of the invoices to be sent. 
    2) Click on the "Email" drop-down, and select "Batch"
    3) Review the list of invoices included in the batch, to make sure there are no surprises. The "Date" field will help you identify any old invoices mistakenly included in the batch.
    4) Note the number of invoices included in the batch. This number, plus the number of invoices which you sent out manually, should equal the number of members invoiced this month.
    5) On the email form side, make sure "Dues Invoice" template has been selected.
    6) "Send Now"
