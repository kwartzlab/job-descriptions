Best Practices: New Members
===========================

Once a membership application has been accepted, the new member needs to be set up in Quickbooks (Customer Centre >> New Customer and Job >> New Customer), and invoiced for their start-up fee and first month's dues.

Use the member's legal name in both the "Customer Name" field, and also the "Full Name" field. Enter in the email address (where invoices will be sent), and also the postal address (where letter mail will be sent). "Customer Name" is the field that Quickbooks will show you in customer lists. "Full Name" is the field that will appear in email salutations. 

Under Payment Settings, set the following:

    Payment Terms: Net 15 
    Preferred Delivery Method: Email 
    
These settings will ensure that future dues invoices will be automatically generated with the correct settings, so that you can send out batch emails without having to manually edit invoices first. 

Once the initial invoice has been paid, you can move them in to the next monthly invoicing cycle. We don't do this right away, because some new members may take more than a month to pay their initial invoice. On the next invoicing day (the 10th of the month), manually create a monthly dues invoice. Make sure the invoice has Net 15 terms, and "Email Later" is selected. If you have to adjust these settings, save the invoice, and then reopen it. Add the invoice to your memorized "Monthly Membership N15" list, so that it will be automatically generated in future months.
