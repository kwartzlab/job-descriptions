Best Practices: Member Reimbursements
=====================================

(This is long and wordy and can almost certainly be better documented!)

Members (should) submit reimbursement requests through a form on the website -- http://www.kwartzlab.ca/reimbursement-request-form/

(Verbiage on the website needs to be updated to reflect changes in approvals -- no more <$50 consumable thing)

This form is driven by JotForm, and does the following:

* saves a copy of the submission to JotForm
* sends an email to admin@ (this should be members@, but we had issues with form submissions to members not always coming through)
* posts a new record to the Reimbursements Request spreadsheet in Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CH70UORj9fUz4u5dzNBSERP93YN5T3O0o7RsnnXkUMc/edit#gid=1513055170

When a reimbursement email comes in to the mailing list:

1. Open the Reimbursements Request spreadsheet in Google Docs (you will need to log in to Google with the events@kwartzlab.ca account), and go in to the "Transformed" sheet.
2. Click the big blue "Update" button in cell A1. This will take the raw submission records (stored in the "Submissions" sheet), transform them for easier processing, and copy them in to the "Transformed" sheet. New records will appear at the bottom of the list, so you will need to scroll down. If the request included multiple items, you will see a separate record for each item.
3. Copy the formulas from column J & K in to your new rows. For each item, this will give you the pre-tax and reimbursement totals for the item. These values will be useful when recording the reimbursements in Quickbooks.  (Members are inconsistent in how they include HST in the amounts they claim, so this saves us having to do math!)
4. For each reimbursement item, take a look at Column E, and determine what sort of approval was provided. Purchases can be approved/authorized in a variety of ways:
  * Purchasing Approval. In most cases, a member should request (and be granted) approval before they make a purchase. In this case, they will have a Purcashing Approval #, which they should have noted in Column E. Note that sometimes members have purchasing approval, but don't bother to record the number here, so if the item sounds familiar, you may have to search your records/email history/etc. If there is a purchasing approval number, that does NOT meant the purchase was approved, only that approval was request. You will need to check that the request was approved, and note in column L ("Approved") how the approval was granted. If all directors provided a +1 on the mailing list, then just enter "ML" in Column L. If the board voted on this at a board meeting, record "BM#" and the meeting number in Column L. In either case, also make sure the Purchasing Approval number is recorded in Colum E. If purchasing approval was requested, but not received, then the request still needs to be approved by the board before you can process it.
  * Board Approval without a PA#. Same deal as above. There should either be a mailing list thread with +1 from all directors, or a board meeting where the approval was voted on. In this case, because there is no PA#, just make sure that Column E has something sensible which will make it easy to recognize what the purchasing was about, if you ever need to look for something in the future. 
  * Warden Budget. 3 wardens have their own budgets that they control spending on. Confirm with the warden that they authorize the spending, and also check in quickbooks that the money is available in their budget. If the warden authorize the expense, and there is enough money in their budget to cover it, note the warden approval in Column L. If the warden authorized the expense, but there is not enough money in their budget, then the board will need to approve the spending.
5. If any items are not already approved, then the board will need to approve them before you process the reimbursement. Forward the Reimbursement Request email to the members list, noting that the request is not pre-approved, and ask the board to approve it. If the board approves it, then note the approval in Column L of the spreadsheet (either as "ML" or as "BM#")
6. Once you know how each item is approved, note which Fund the money will come from in Column  
7. Record the reimbursement in Quickbooks. We will enter this as a single transaction (rather than entering a bill, and then entering a payment), by selecting "Write Checks" from the "Banking".
  * BANK ACCOUNT: Select the Bank Account that corresponds to the Fund the money should be drawn from. (E.g., Operating Expenses are pulled from the Operations Fund; Discretionary Expenses from the Discretionary Fund; cleaning supplies from the "Operations Fund:Cleaning Warden Fund"). If the reimbursement request includes items paid for through different funds, for example both Discretionary and Operations, you can either write a separate cheque for each fund, or you can write the full reimbursement from one fund (for instance Discretionary), and then transfer the Operations portion of the reimbursement from the Operations Fund to the Discretionary Fund. 
  * NO: the cheque number, corresponding to the physical check you will write
  * DATE: today's date
  * PAY TO THE ORDER OF: the name of the member receiving the reimbursement
  * $: the total value of the reimbursement check. Refer to colum K ("Total") in the reimbursement spreedsheet. If you are reimbursing multiple items on a single check, select the total of each item you are including to get the SUM.
