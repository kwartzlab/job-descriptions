Best Practices: Member Reimbursements
=====================================

Members (should) submit reimbursement requests through a form on the website -- http://www.kwartzlab.ca/reimbursement-request-form/

(Verbiage on the website needs to be updated to reflect changes in approvals -- no more <$50 consumable thing)

This form is driven by JotForm, and does the following:

* saves a copy of the submission to JotForm
* sends an email to admin@ (this should be members@, but we had issues with form submissions to members not always coming through)
* posts a new record to the Reimbursements Request spreadsheet in Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CH70UORj9fUz4u5dzNBSERP93YN5T3O0o7RsnnXkUMc/edit#gid=1513055170

When a reimbursement email comes in to the mailing list:

1. Open the Reimbursements Request spreadsheet in Google Docs (you will need to log in to Google with the events@kwartzlab.ca account), and go in to the "Transformed" sheet.
2. Click the big blue "Update" button in cell A1. This will take the raw submission records (stored in the "Submissions" sheet), transform them for easier processing, and copy them in to the "Transformed" sheet. New records will appear at the bottom of the list, so you will need to scroll down. If the request included multiple items, you will see a separate record for each item.
3. Copy the formulas from column J & K in to your new rows. For each item, this will give you the pre-tax and reimbursement totals for the item. These values will be useful when recording the reimbursements in Quickbooks.  (Members are inconsistent in how they include HST in the amounts they claim, so this saves us having to do math!)
4. For each reimbursement item, take a look at Column E, and determine what sort of approval was provided. Purchases can be approved/authorized in a variety of ways:
  * Purchasing Approval. In most cases, a member should request (and be granted) approval before they make a purchase. In this case, they will have a Purcashing Approval #, which they should have noted in Column E. Note that sometimes members have purchasing approval, but don't bother to record the number here, so if the item sounds familiar, you have to search your records/email history/etc. If there is a purchasing approval number, that does NOT meant the purchase was approved, only that approval was request. You will need to check that the request was approved, and note in column L ("Approved") how the approval was granted. If all directors provided a +1 on the mailing list, then just enter "ML" in Column L. If the board voted on this at a board meeting, record "BM#" and the meeting number in Column L. In either case, also make sure the Purchasing Approval number is recorded in Colum E. If the purchase was not approved, then you cannot process the reimbursement request yet.
  * Board Approval without a PA#. Same deal as above. There should either be a mailing list thread with +1 from all directors, or a board meeting where the approval was voted on. In this case, because there is no PA#, just make sure that Column E has something sensible which will make it easy to recognize what the purchasing was about, if you ever need to look for something in the future. 
  * Warden Budget. 3 wardens have their own budgets that they control spending on. Confirm with the warden that they authorize the spending, and also confirm with quickbooks that the money is available in their budget.
