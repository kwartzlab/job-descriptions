Best Practices: Receiving Monies
=================================

PAYPAL

PayPal allows people to send either automated recurring or one-off payments electronically. These payments are automatically received in to our PayPal account, so nothing needs to be done to receive them; you just need to record the payments as they come in. Once a month, you will then transfer the PayPal account balance over to our chequing account.

When a payment is received, PayPal will send treasurer@kwartzlab.ca (or accounts@kwartzlab.ca, which is an alias for treasurer@) an email, containing the payment details. All of these details are also recorded in our PayPal statements, so the emails do not need to be kept. You can decide whether its easier to record the payments based using the emails as they come in, or to record them off of the monthly PayPal statements available online. 

To record the payment in Quickbooks, use the date that PayPal received the payment, rather than the date you are recording it. Select the "PayPal" payment method, and use the PayPal transaction ID# for the reference #. Deposit to the "PayPal" account. In the Memo field, also include the sender's name, as it appears on the PayPal transaction (this may be different than the member name as it appears in QuickBooks). 

INTERAC E-TRANSFERS

INTERAC e-Transfers are a way of sending one-off payments electronically. Unlike PayPal, e-Transfers cannot be scheduled as an automated, recurring transfer. Members who pay their dues by INTERAC e-Transfer will need to manually send the payment each month.

In order to send an INTERAC e-Transfer, the sender must use a bank which supports this online payment method. The exact process for sending a payment will vary depending on the bank, so if a member is uncertain how to proceed, advice them to contact their bank for assistance.

When the somebody sends a payment, they will set a password for it as well. Many members use the same password for each payment they send; some members will change the password with each payment. Passwords should be saved in the user's Customer file in Quickbooks, under "notes". 

If you are uncertain what the password is, contact the sender rather than guessing -- INTERAC will cancel the payment after 3 password errors. 

When a payment has been sent, treasurer@kwartzlab.ca will receive an email from INTERAC with the payment details (the sender and amount), and a link to collect the payment. You will have 30 days to collect the payment, after which time it will be cancelled.

When you click on the payment link, you will be taken to an INTERAC web page, where you can select which bank you want to deposit the funds to. Choose TD Canada Trust. From there, you will be redirected to the TD website, and prompted to log in. 

Ideally, once you are logged in, you will be redirected to a page asking you to provide the payment password. After providing the correct password, you will be asked which account you would like to deposit the funds to. 

Sometimes, after logging in to the account, you are not redirected to the payment page. In this case, leave the web banking tab open (and your account logged in), and go back to your email. Click on the INTERAC link again, and repeat the process. This time, you should be taken directly to the payment page. 

Once the money has been deposited in to our account, you'll be taken to a confirmation page. Keep this page open.

To record the payment in QuickBooks, use the date that the payment was collected (not the date that the INTERAC email was sent), and select "Interac Debit" as the payment methord. For the reference number, copy the confirmation number from the payment confirmation page. (This will debit will show up on the bank statement as "E TFR xxxxxxxx"). If the payment is membership dues, deposit directly to "Chequing (TD Canada TRust): Operations Fund". If the payment is for something else, deposit to the appropriate account.

Lastly, save a PDF of the confirmation page, and file it with the electronic copies of monthly invoices and receipts. On the TD bank statement, INTERAC e-transfer don't include any sender details, so this PDF will be your record of who made what payment. This may come in handy when reconciling the account at the end of the month, or confirming a payment after the fact.
